# Electricity Consumption Forecasting

This project involves forecasting electricity consumption using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost regressor. The dataset used for this analysis includes various factors such as consumption, production, nuclear energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, oil and gas consumption, coal consumption, solar energy, and biomass energy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Consumption**: Total electricity consumption.
- **Production**: Total electricity production.
- **Nuclear**: Nuclear energy production or consumption.
- **Wind**: Wind energy production.
- **Hydroelectric**: Hydroelectric power production.
- **Oil and Gas**: Consumption of oil and gas for electricity generation.
- **Coal**: Coal consumption for electricity generation.
- **Solar**: Solar energy production.
- **Biomass**: Biomass energy production.

This dataset can be used to analyze the historical trends in electricity consumption and production and to forecast future electricity consumption based on various factors.
